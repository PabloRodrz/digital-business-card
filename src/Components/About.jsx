      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I'm 22 and I'm a music teacher gratuated from Conservatorio Superior de Música Félix T. Garzón.
        2 years ago I started to get interested in front end software development and then, after a while, I
         decided to learn about it via online courses and with a Sr. mentor. <br />
        I feel motivated to learn, grow and develop my career in this fascinating area with a group of people full 
        of empathy, good comunication and sinergy.</p>
